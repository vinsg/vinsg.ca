On May 25th, 2024, I embarked on a weight loss journey to lose 36 lb. I accomplished my goal on // insert goal // and this is what I've learned from the experience.
## Why

- **Improve my physique**:
    - While I was only slightly overweight, I wanted to achieve a better-looking figure for personal satisfaction.
- **Control emotional eating**:
    - I had a tendency to eat my emotions.
    - I was dealing with a lot of anxiety at that point in my life.
    - I had a weakness for dairy-free cheese.
- **Learn my body:** 
	- I've been somewhat of a budgy nerd my entire life (minus a bout of hardcore MMA training). I want to see how far I can push my body before my metabolism starts to slow down with old age.
- **Had time for myself**:
    - Access to a kitchen for meal prep.
    - Long stretches of alone time to focus on building habits and routines.

## The Experience

### Tools I Used

- Lose It app for tracking - You have to track your progress and calories, any app or a simple notebook will do.
- Workout/Activity tracking watch and app - Track physical activity to make sure I was always hitting a base level of steps.
- Body weight scale - Weight myself every day to track progress.
- Meal prep containers and kitchen scale - Control food portions.

### The Process

The initial aim was a goal weight of 142 lb. This is somewhat of an arbitrary number felt right at the time. It also happens to be the middle of my BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) for my age and height. This goal is about 2-3% below my expected maintenance weight of 145 because I expected a small rebound with normal fluctuations.

The first five pounds came out almost immediately. Those were the initial water weight and my rate stabilized afterwards towards 2-3 lbs per week. I was able to maintain that rate for most of the diet but I started to slow down significantly after 20 lb.

Early on I decided to run 5k every single day. This turned out to be a great initiative. While not enough by itself to put me in a calorie deficit, it gave me a floor of minimum physical activity. This worked well on days I didn't want to do anything.

Throughout the entire process, I felt quite a bit of hunger but nothing too debilitating. I kept most of my "junk" food in my pantry and never once got tempted to eat any of it. I think a key aspect of this diet was to completely give up on deserts and other junk food. After about a month, you lose the taste and forget how a bag of chips tastes.

The last 10 lbs were the hardest to lose by far and diet fatigue was settling in. My body got used to the lower calorie intake and I had to drastically cut calories (below 1300kcal) to keep my progress pace. This is not something I would recommend anyone to do as it comes with severe cravings and a collapse of energy. I kinda saw it as a small sprint across the finish line.

Social events were also a bit difficult to navigate. You want to stay on track conflicts with the desire to participate with everyone. I managed it with a few tricks:
- Limit to only one glass of alcohol or better no alcohol at all.
- Fast before the event to give more room for off-diet food.
- Exercise prior to or after the event.

### Random Helpful Tips

- Have a clear goal and finishing line.
- Weigh yourself daily and track progress.
- Friction in the tracking process can deter binge eating.
- Should probably take a daily multivitamin.
- Running at least 5k daily ensures a baseline of physical activity.
- Cut alcohol, snacks and desserts entirely.
- Coleslaw mix are great to add bulk to meals without many calories.
- Egg whites and Greek yogurt are great low-fat protein sources.
- Use spray oil to reduce cooking oil usage.

## Retrospective

### The Good
- Significant change in appearance. I severely underestimated the change 36 lb would do to my physique. I fit better in my clothing and feel much lighter on my feet.
- Lost the desire to stress eat.
- Staying with the diet was motivating and very rewarding. Winning the battle every day is a small victory and it compounds over time. 
- Meal prepping saved time during the workweek
- Broke down mental barriers about my physical capabilities and what I can achieve.

### The Bad
- Meals had too much fat for too long. I did not pay attention to macros, this led to an unbalanced diet.
- Not enough protein.
- Restricting myself during social gatherings was mentally taxing.
### The Ugly
- Lack of exercise led to muscle loss. While not terrible, it is unfortunate that I neglected weight training which could have saved a bit of muscle that I will have to work back. 
- Felt noticeably weak towards the end of the diet.
- Lack of energy to do other things.

## Towards the Periodization of Fat Loss and Muscle Gain

I plan to alternate between three phases:
1. **Fat Loss Diet:** Similar to what I just completed, but less aggressive. Better to aim for 8-10% body fat loss at a time.
2. **Maintenance Phase:** Eating at calorie maintenance to let my body adjust to the new weight and reset any diet fatigue.
3. **Muscle Gain Diet:** A calorie surplus phase to gain muscle (and some fat, which will be shed in the next fat loss phase).

The next few weeks will be spent at a maintenance diet to stabilize my new weight. Then, I'll likely run another diet to 132 lb. My goal is to build upon the good habits I've developed during this diet and prepare for the next phase.
